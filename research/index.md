The Phipson laboratory works on both novel bioinformatics methods development as well as collaborative analysis projects with scientists within and external to the Institute. We use sophisticated statistical modelling to reveal insights into normal development and disease.

A major research focus of the Phipson laboratory is on developing new bioinformatics methods for data generated from single cell technologies. We also work on genomic data generated from other high-throughput technologies including RNA-seq and DNA methylation. Our novel bioinformatics methods are implemented as publicly available open source software through the Bioconductor project.

Current research areas of interest include:
– Developing statistical methods for designed single cell experiments with biological replication
– Advancing DNA methylation analysis for current and emerging technologies
